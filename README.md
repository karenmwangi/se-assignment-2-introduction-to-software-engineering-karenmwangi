# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. The difference between the two are the methodologies used in the process, the design patterns and the scope.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1- requirements where gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements is done
2- design where high-level and detailed designs of the software architechture are created
3- implementation where writing code and building the software is done to the specifications
4- testing to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5- deploymemt of the software to the users
6- maintaining, providing support and enhancements to the customers

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is a iterative approach that responds to change and flexibility while waterfall is sequential approach with dictinct phases flowing downwards hence the name waterfall. The preference of models depends on the type of project, team dynamics and adaptability to change.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
it is the process of gathering information on requirements from the stakeholders, analyzing it and documenting it after which it is validated to ensure it accurately reflects the stakeholders. This entails describing the specific functions, attributes and limitations within the system must operate. Clearl defined requirements can lead to higher quality products and identifying and addressing issues in the requirements phase can save from costly changes in the development process.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a princple that promotes the division of a system into manageable modules that are independent. Breaking the system into bits reduces complexity allowing changes to be made within a module without affecting other modules. This allows for easier updates and enhancements.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing refers to testing individual modules of a software while intergration testing refers to testing the interactions between different components. System testing refers to testing the entire system as a whole while acceptance testing refers to testing the system against the user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools for tracking changes is source code an coordinating work among team mates. These are important bacause they allow early detection of issues and overal maintainability of software systems. An example of a vrsion control system is Git 

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager is to lead a team to achieve all project goals within the constraints. Their key responsibilities are outlining objectives and deliverables and developing timelines and workplans. Main challenges faced include limitations in time, budget and scope of the project.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance icludes providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment. Intergrating changes based on the feedback from users and enhancing the system as the industry evolves.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Two examples are the issues of privacy and security. Unauthorized data collection, misuse of personal information and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers are ethical challenges faced by software engineers. Implementing strong data protection measures and ensuring robust security practices are ways to mitigate these issues and adhere to ethical standards.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by 12th june 2024.
